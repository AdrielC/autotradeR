Source: Edmunds* The 2015 Jeep Wrangler remains an icon. The original 4x4 freedom machine offers the ultimate in capability without compromise. Holding true to its rugged heritage but ramping up the comfort factor in ride and handling. For increased versatility, choose the Wrangler Unlimited with its four doors, room for five and all the cargo capacity you need for your next adventure. Premium soft-touch materials and thoughtfully designed ergonomics mean you'll be comfortable on- and off-road. A five-speed automatic transmission delivers refined shifting and improved performance. Comfort features include: available heated front seats, Automatic Temperature Control, steering wheel audio controls, leather-trimmed seats, and more. An Infinity Premium Sound System has seven speakers, including a subwoofer and a 368-watt amp that will make your favorite songs sound even better. Jeep 4x4's are tested on some of the toughest off-road areas in the world, including Moab and the famed Rubicon Trail. All Wrangler models come equipped with Trail Rated 4WD systems as standard equipment: choose from the tough Command-Trac or the made-for-mountains Rock-Trac. Wrangler Rubicon offers standard 32-inch BFGoodrich off-road tires with biting edges for wicked weather or ragged rocks. The 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine delivers 285hp and 260 pound-feet of torque with fuel efficiency up to 21mpg.
