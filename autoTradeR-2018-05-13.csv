It is also very comfortable for the driver, as well as the passengers, and has several add-ons to increase the comfort and look.  There is also a HUGE amount of storage in the trunk area.  The back seats lay down, which provides an even larger space.  I have owned many jeeps in my life, and this one has BY FAR the most storage space.  Don't let this pass you up!

I've recently been accepted into law school and cannot see this sit in the garage for the next few years. I purchased this New in 2016 from Lakeshore Jeep Slidell, It was specifically ordered exactly the way I wanted it, white on white, with remote start, SAHARA (NOT SPORT). The Jeep was torn down at a local professional body shop the 1st week and every part was painted white(mirrors, handles, bumpers, interior pieces, grille, step side, tail lights, everything),it then went to another shop to get Fox lift kit 6.5&quot;.  Then it went to the wheel shop and got a set of (5) 24&quot;x12&quot; American Force polished wheels, with Toyo 37's.Then it went to the tint shop and got all 8 windows (including front) tinted with Ceramic. Then most importantly it went to gear shop to get 4.88 gears put in front and rear to handle the tires. Then it went to the leather shop and got upgraded custom made leather seats. There are too many small parts and pieces to list, but the Jeep was done right! Not an overly armored chopped impractical vehicle.  This stays garage kept, and has only seen rain maybe twice.  Doors have never even been off.  Never seen mud, Never sat outside more than 8 hours at a time.  This was not a daily, it was a weekend toy. I will be purchasing a new one after school and redoing this the same way.  It consistently gets compliments no matter where I go.  The system is a full alpine upgraded factory system with Sub mounted flush in the floor. The headunit is an android tablet that has internet etc.IT sounds AMAZING!!! , A/C ice cold, All scheduled maintenance, All records, Always garaged, Custom paint/ Custom wheels, GPS system, Fully loaded with all the goodies,New tires, No accidents, Non-smoker, One owner, Perfect first car, Satellite radio, Seats like new, Still under factory warranty, A MUST SEE VEHICLE.

While a trail-rated, six-speed, two-door, soft-top Jeep is awesome for dirt roads, snow, and summer drives with the top down, it is not great for child seats, infants, or wives who find it hard to shift and waive a rattle around.  So, the new kid is in, and my Wrangler is out.I bought this Jeep new in 2007.  I actually ordered it from the factory while I was deployed with the U.S. Army in 2006.  I had dreams of lifting it, slapping on some big, bad tires, and taking it off road.  As you can see from the photos, that never happened.  It s pretty much still stock, and it has rarely felt anything but pavement.  It has an after-market Pioneer stereo (iPhone hookup and Bluetooth) to go with the factory-upgraded Infinity speakers and subwoofer.  Clean CARFAX.I did your comparison shopping for you (but you should still do your own research), and here s what I found: Jeeps like this list around $12,900.  Those Jeeps have better wheels and newer tops.  They typically have higher miles, and they don t have the upgraded speakers.  Wear and tear is similar.  My Jeep has a golf ball size dent in the passenger door, and I ve worn out the steering wheel and floor.  Apparently, I ve put my hand and heel in the same spots everyday for the last ten years.  You can t Jeep Waive from anywhere else, though.  (If you re not going to Jeep Waive, don t call.)  There s a red one in Colorado Springs for $10,500 with 116,000 miles and a hard top.  There might be something wrong with it, but if there isn t, that s a great deal, and you should go buy that one!

Comes with Sport Package 23B featuring A/C, Freedom Top black 3 piece hard top w/t-top storage bag & other goodies (see last scan for window sticker). The price of the Jeep new pre- tax with these options was $26,475. In addition, the original owner (I'm the 2nd) added running boards, front Weather Tech mats & 5 new wheels & tires from a Jeep Rubicon. The tires have very little wear (spare is unused) & are BF Goodrich Mud Terrain T/A's (LT255/75R17). The Freedom Top can be removed or used as a T-Top without removing the entire top.It's like getting a new Jeep Wrangler Sport with Rubicon elements at a discount. The only glitch is the tire pressure warning light stays on because of the difference in the larger Rubicon tires vs the standard Wrangler tires. I was told this can be adjusted at most Jeep dealerships, but it never was an issue with me. Speaking of Jeep dealerships, I believe the 5 year or 100,000 mile Powertrain/Roadside Assistance Limited Warranty goes with the vehicle (possible transfer fee). Bonus: This was the last year of the 100,000 Mile Warranty. Since the Jeep was first registered on 07-28-15, there may be several months left on the 3 year or 36K mile Basic Limited Warranty. Seems logical but I can't guarantee it. The reason I'm letting this great Jeep Wrangler go is because from day one my older Collie couldn't jump up in the back. Thus the Jeep has sat in my garage, getting very little use. The top has never been off & the Jeep has never been off-road. It comes with 2 ignition/door keys, a Jeep tool kit, document holder, the original Owner's Manual/User Guide & all records.Shipping arrangements & fees are the responsibility of the buyer. Payment via wire transfer preferred.

Pretty much ever modification to this Jeep has been done with a focus on function without entirely compromising its use as a daily driver.'But wait!' you say, 'If this Jeep is as awesome as you say then why would you sell it?' - 'Good question strawman I just invented'. Last July I got knocked off my Harley by an inattentive kid and lost the last 18 inches of my right leg.

I'm selling the family Jeep. Was my old mans, bought it new in 2002, I picked it up in 2012 and started to go to work. With a little over 90k original miles, this Jeep is clean, built for any weekend getaway, and cruises comfortably on the freeway. Maintenance, Nothing is deferred. This beautiful thing is at home on any overland trail, or running 75 up the 395. It's had quite a few upgrades since I picked it up. There's probably more, but here goes...First I added a new Bestop black sailcloth softop. Then I upgraded to the full doors. From there is where the fun stuff started happening: connected with metalcloak and got the full overline removable fenders, aluminum corner guards, and steel rock rails. Oh, and I added the aluminum inner fender wells also. All of these are powder coated by embee. White is body color and grey around the edges. Kept the stock height and increased the spring weight thanks to Deaver springs for some custom coils for the added steel and bumpers. Finished that off with some ultra wheels and Goodyear Kevlar MTR's and a set of bilstein 5100 shocks. Rides smooth! From there I went to LOD and picked up the rear bumper, tire carrier, rotopax and highlift mounts with trail basket. Went all LED with truck-lites, and Genright tail lights. Added 4 rigid cubes, two on the A pillar and two in the rear wired to OEM dash switches and a rigid 10?lightbar on the poison spyder front bumper. Changed over the brakes to black magic setup, rotors, pads, etc. rebuilt the transmission with HD plates, and a shift kit. Banks engineering added intake, headers, exhaust, and programmer- all dyno?d By banks. Full stereo upgrade with for gate Amp and kicker speakers, bestop waterproof seat covers front and rear, added spiderwebshade Bimini, poison spider hood louvers, an HD alternator, new radiator, and much  Jeep is a great daily driver and capable of 2000 mi.

If you have a real need for all-season capability, 4-Doors, or simply a strong desire to depart the beaten path, my 2012 Jeep Wrangler is a tough recipe to beat. I've maintained her well and only put 52K miles on her in 6 years, she's basically a new car, never had an accident and never broken down. Under the hood sits a powerful 3.6 liter V6 that produces 285 horsepower and almost as much torque. Combined with the rock-solid Dana front and rear axles, this 5-Speed automatic transmission will allow you to maintain civility or allow you to carve your own path where ever you see fit thanks to the locking differentials, Rock-Trac HD transfer case, and gas charged. This jeep goes beyond basic by offering Air Conditioning, 4 wheel drive, power windows/locks, and special badging. With city streets and freeways providing an increasingly unfriendly atmosphere to standard, car-based suspension and real ground clearance are increasingly handy for the committed urbanite. If you get the urge to take an open-air cruise, just remove the top, put on some shades, crank up the Infinity sound system, and hit the road! A strong safety cage surrounds you, multi stage airbags protect you, and Hill-start and stability control help you along the way. My arctic offers all of the legendary rock-climbing ability of America's favorite off-roader, with a dose of comfort to go along for the ride!-This is $3K below market value-She's been meticulously detailed-No off roading, ever -Inspected and given a full fluid refresh and certification by dealership of perfect mechanical conditionWhy I am selling her: I moved to Seattle from Texas in 2014 and rarely ever drive her, hence why she has 52K miles in just 6 years. I work from home and Seattle is a smaller city that I can easily navigate on foot, she sits in the garage and is useful when I have family in town a few times a year.",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Arctic,2012,Used,Huntsville,Private,NA,NA

It has been reliable.  I recently had some 120,000 mile service done and also replaced the clutch system components.  I have taken good care of the Jeep, and I have depended on it for my daily drive.  It is also great for a weekend trail ride with the top off or with the freedom panels removed.  The 4 doors makes it easy to bring the family along. This Jeep is stock except I added a custom metal front bumper with front hitch.  I also added some wiring and connector for a hitch mounted portable winch.  The Rubicon is the best Jeep for stock off-road capabilities and  includes a electronic disconnecting front sway bar, locking differentials/axles both front and rear.

Non-smoker vehicle. The Jeep is 2WD.I have priced the Jeep to sell. Kelly Blue Book puts the private seller midpoint at $14,500 for good condition. I have priced it at $13,500.The jeep does burn about 1qt. of oil / 2000 miles and the coolant needs to be topped off every once in a while. A few times in the last year it took multiple attempts to start the Jeep, but has always started. The horn doesn't work (which was a good thing in my case).

The listed vehicle is a 2006 Jeep Rubicon. Here's a story about how I've owned it (Over a year now)I bought this car on Autotrader from a guy out in California who said this drove like a Cadillac. I had my cousin confirm it. I shipped it to Ohio to realize it was a monster truck of a Cadillac.The car was hardly driven for 10 years. It's main purpose was for off roading. I needed something to drive at higher speeds though. So, since I've owned the vehicle, I have lowered the lift by half (6 to 3 inches) putting brand new brackets on & suspension & 5 new tires. I still need to replace the windshield, but In the meantime, my current asking price reflects the current value I believe the vehicle is worth. The car is my baby & I practically wash it every 3 days. Only text me if you're serious. I bought this car for $24,000 & had to put another $5,000 in it. There is little wiggle room. The jeep is more favorable getting dirty on a trail then on the highway in luxury FYI. Enthused Jeep drivers only.

This jeep was a custom order that has the Connectivity Package for Bluetooth phone and top of the line soft top.  Once the Jeep came in from the factory, the build began.  This Jeep is loaded with the best accessories that they make - and is always garaged and never has even been in the rain yet !!  - Nor has it been outside since the beginning of October, so no salt on it EVER yet.  My friends laugh cause it's the cleanest jeep ever.New accessories from the build include :  35 inch Nitto Tires, Fuel Wheels, LED Headlights, LED Light Bar that floats above the front bumper, LED Black Out Taillights, LED Fender Lights (white), New Polk Weather Resistant Speakers all around from Crutchfield, Warn Front and Rear Bumpers (almost $3k in bumpers alone) - back Warn Bumper has the Tire Carrier swing arm so the weight of the wheel is not on the door...it's on the bumper, Full 4&quot; Rancho Suspension Lift complete with new shocks - not the cheap set either !  The seat covers are Jeep Embroidered Wet Suit Seat Covers...over $700 for the set.  The floor mats are the Jeep wheel treads ones all the way through it.  The Jeep comes with a complete set of Rancho Pipe Doors with Mopar Mirrors mounted on them already...so they never shake in the wind when going 60 mph (approx $850).  New exhaust too - dual exhaust and muffler from Borla ($700), Side set of rock sliders/bars/steps - black powder coated.  Jeep is immaculate.  It only has 1,200 miles on it.  Got almost $60k invested in it.  I don't need to sell it...I have multiple toys (trucks, Harleys, etc.) ...just love building them and trying to figure out what I'm going to do next.I'm not looking to trade it for anything... I'm going to let it go so much cheaper than I have in it.  However, I will not go lower than what I have listed - it's a steal at this price and it looks too darn good to be sitting in the garag",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Unlimited Sport S,2017,Used,Huntsville,Private,NA,NA

There is a JL Audio amplifier hidden behind the glove box. Under the back seats are two 6.5&quot; Bazooka Bass Tubes- The jeep does have the navigation with a back up camera.- Lighting: all interior lights replaced with LEDs. Head lights and fog lights replaced with LEDs from Quadratec. Over $1000 in light upgrades.- I have factory rubber floor mats and the factory carpeted ones.- Lift: this is a 2.5&quot; budget boost from teraflex. I went with this kit because I wanted to retain the stock ride- New heavy duty track bar installed. Without this these lifted jeeps go all over the road if you hit a bump. Now it drives perfectly straight and better than stock.- Wheels and tires: pro comp wheels with less than 200 miles on them. The tires are 35&quot; x 12.5&quot; BFG KO2 All terrain.- To keep the stock feel I had the gears changed out from the stock 3.21 to a 4.56 ratio front and rear. These are needed with the big tires. Also, while I was in there I had a Tru track Detroit limited slip installed in the rear end (Dana 44). Front is still open. This work was done by the dealer!!- Condition: absolutely immaculate! Not a nicer jeep out there. Even better than new. It basically gets waxed 4 times a year and marinates in high-end Griots car care products. I have 8 different cleaners and conditioners I use on it. Not a single scratch, let alone a swirl mark on the jeep.- Other options: trailer hitch- Factory warranty still good, plus I was an idiot and paid for an extended warranty that is transferable. I believe it extends it another 3 years.- Oil changed by dealer",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Unlimited Sport,2015,Used,Huntsville,Private,NA,NA
