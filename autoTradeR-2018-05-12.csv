While a trail-rated, six-speed, two-door, soft-top Jeep is awesome for dirt roads, snow, and summer drives with the top down, it is not great for child seats, infants, or wives who find it hard to shift and waive a rattle around.  So, the new kid is in, and my Wrangler is out.I bought this Jeep new in 2007.  I actually ordered it from the factory while I was deployed with the U.S. Army in 2006.  I had dreams of lifting it, slapping on some big, bad tires, and taking it off road.  As you can see from the photos, that never happened.  It s pretty much still stock, and it has rarely felt anything but pavement.  It has an after-market Pioneer stereo (iPhone hookup and Bluetooth) to go with the factory-upgraded Infinity speakers and subwoofer.  Clean CARFAX.I did your comparison shopping for you (but you should still do your own research), and here s what I found: Jeeps like this list around $12,900.  Those Jeeps have better wheels and newer tops.  They typically have higher miles, and they don t have the upgraded speakers.  Wear and tear is similar.  My Jeep has a golf ball size dent in the passenger door, and I ve worn out the steering wheel and floor.  Apparently, I ve put my hand and heel in the same spots everyday for the last ten years.  You can t Jeep Waive from anywhere else, though.  (If you re not going to Jeep Waive, don t call.)  There s a red one in Colorado Springs for $10,500 with 116,000 miles and a hard top.

The car has been well maintained over that time (I still have all the service records). I have never had a major issue with the car. New tires put on it last year.Four wheel drive has been great in the snow or mud. In general, I have been really happy with the vehicle.The car also comes with a cover that helps keep it clean and take less abuse from the sun. I also have a rear rack that is great for hauling gear if you have 4 people in the car.

Comes with Sport Package 23B featuring A/C, Freedom Top black 3 piece hard top w/t-top storage bag & other goodies (see last scan for window sticker). The price of the Jeep new pre- tax with these options was $26,475. In addition, the original owner (I'm the 2nd) added running boards, front Weather Tech mats & 5 new wheels & tires from a Jeep Rubicon. The tires have very little wear (spare is unused) & are BF Goodrich Mud Terrain T/A's (LT255/75R17). The Freedom Top can be removed or used as a T-Top without removing the entire top.It's like getting a new Jeep Wrangler Sport with Rubicon elements at a discount. The only glitch is the tire pressure warning light stays on because of the difference in the larger Rubicon tires vs the standard Wrangler tires. I was told this can be adjusted at most Jeep dealerships, but it never was an issue with me. Speaking of Jeep dealerships, I believe the 5 year or 100,000 mile Powertrain/Roadside Assistance Limited Warranty goes with the vehicle (possible transfer fee). Bonus: This was the last year of the 100,000 Mile Warranty. Since the Jeep was first registered on 07-28-15, there may be several months left on the 3 year or 36K mile Basic Limited Warranty. Seems logical but I can't guarantee it. The reason I'm letting this great Jeep Wrangler go is because from day one my older Collie couldn't jump up in the back. Thus the Jeep has sat in my garage, getting very little use. The top has never been off & the Jeep has never been off-road. It comes with 2 ignition/door keys, a Jeep tool kit, document holder, the original Owner's Manual/User Guide & all records.Shipping arrangements & fees are the responsibility of the buyer.

I'm selling the family Jeep. Was my old mans, bought it new in 2002, I picked it up in 2012 and started to go to work. With a little over 90k original miles, this Jeep is clean, built for any weekend getaway, and cruises comfortably on the freeway. Maintenance, Nothing is deferred. This beautiful thing is at home on any overland trail, or running 75 up the 395. It's had quite a few upgrades since I picked it up. There's probably more, but here goes...First I added a new Bestop black sailcloth softop. Then I upgraded to the full doors. From there is where the fun stuff started happening: connected with metalcloak and got the full overline removable fenders, aluminum corner guards, and steel rock rails. Oh, and I added the aluminum inner fender wells also. All of these are powder coated by embee. White is body color and grey around the edges. Kept the stock height and increased the spring weight thanks to Deaver springs for some custom coils for the added steel and bumpers. Finished that off with some ultra wheels and Goodyear Kevlar MTR's and a set of bilstein 5100 shocks. Rides smooth! From there I went to LOD and picked up the rear bumper, tire carrier, rotopax and highlift mounts with trail basket. Went all LED with truck-lites, and Genright tail lights. Added 4 rigid cubes, two on the A pillar and two in the rear wired to OEM dash switches and a rigid 10?lightbar on the poison spyder front bumper. Changed over the brakes to black magic setup, rotors, pads, etc. rebuilt the transmission with HD plates, and a shift kit. Banks engineering added intake, headers, exhaust, and programmer- all dyno?d By banks. Full stereo upgrade with for gate Amp and kicker speakers, bestop waterproof seat covers front and rear, added spiderwebshade Bimini, poison spider hood louvers, an HD alternator, new radiator, and much  Jeep is a great daily driver and capable of 2000 mi.

If you have a real need for all-season capability, 4-Doors, or simply a strong desire to depart the beaten path, my 2012 Jeep Wrangler is a tough recipe to beat. I've maintained her well and only put 52K miles on her in 6 years, she's basically a new car, never had an accident and never broken down. Under the hood sits a powerful 3.6 liter V6 that produces 285 horsepower and almost as much torque. Combined with the rock-solid Dana front and rear axles, this 5-Speed automatic transmission will allow you to maintain civility or allow you to carve your own path where ever you see fit thanks to the locking differentials, Rock-Trac HD transfer case, and gas charged. This jeep goes beyond basic by offering Air Conditioning, 4 wheel drive, power windows/locks, and special badging. With city streets and freeways providing an increasingly unfriendly atmosphere to standard, car-based suspension and real ground clearance are increasingly handy for the committed urbanite. If you get the urge to take an open-air cruise, just remove the top, put on some shades, crank up the Infinity sound system, and hit the road! A strong safety cage surrounds you, multi stage airbags protect you, and Hill-start and stability control help you along the way. My arctic offers all of the legendary rock-climbing ability of America's favorite off-roader, with a dose of comfort to go along for the ride!-This is $3K below market value-She's been meticulously detailed-No off roading, ever -Inspected and given a full fluid refresh and certification by dealership of perfect mechanical conditionWhy I am selling her: I moved to Seattle from Texas in 2014 and rarely ever drive her, hence why she has 52K miles in just 6 years.
