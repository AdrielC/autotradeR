More information about the 2015 Subaru Outback: The genius of the Outback has always been its ability to straddle classifications; it helped create the crossover segment in the 1990s. As such, the Outback competes with both family cars, SUVs and of course, other crossover vehicles. With a base price just short of $25,000, the Outback should be affordable enough for families considering a new Camry or Accord. With better off-road credentials and a more usable luggage compartment, the Outback offers increased versatility over plain Jane family sedans. At the same time, the Subaru Outback offers the kind of fuel economy that most mid-sized SUVs would struggle to match. Interesting features of this model are good ground clearance, spacious interior, fuel efficient transmissions, standard all-wheel drive, and Versatility *Money-Back Guarantee is valid for 5 days or 250 miles, whichever comes first.

As such, the Outback competes with family cars, SUVs and, of course, other crossover vehicles. With a base price just short of $25,000, the Outback should be affordable enough for families considering a new Camry or Accord. With better off-road credentials and a more usable luggage compartment, the Outback offers increased versatility over plain Jane family sedans. At the same time, the Subaru Outback offers the kind of fuel economy that most mid-sized SUVs struggle to match.Interesting features of this model are fuel-efficient transmissions, standard all-wheel drive, good ground clearance, Versatility, and spacious interior","3 Years/36,000 Miles","5 Years/60,000 Miles",5 Years/Unlimited Miles,"3 Years/36,000 Miles",FALSE,Larry H.
