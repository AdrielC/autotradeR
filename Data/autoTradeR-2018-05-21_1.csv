I especially enjoy the full panoramic sunroof on warm summer nights and the cold weather package comes in very handy for those extra chilly winter mornings (Dual heated seats and heated steering wheel). I've added 1.5&quot; Bora high performance spacers to all four wheels to give this Trail Hawk a crazy aggressive stance. If that's not enough to set you apart from the sea of Cherokees I have also professionally installed a non-functional perfectly painted hood scoop that is sure to be the only Cherokee within 1,000 miles to have such an attachment. It was a custom part that adds unmatched toughness, originality and ruggedness to an already mean looking momma! It drives like a dream and comes with every off-road performance option you could ever want: sport, snow, sand, mud and rock modes to name a few! It even has automatic terrain ascending and descending. The engineers at Jeep truly out did themselves with this vehicle. The only reason I am letting it go is because I simply do not need such a nice vehicle at this point in my life. I drive a total of 10 miles to and from work every day and do not need such a nice vehicle. I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate and fell in love with the vehicle upon first site, however; 8 months later I have come to grips with reality and realize that such a luxury should be afforded after my student loans are taken care of. I am the second owner and the vehicle had 52,000 mostly highway miles on it before I put another 6,500 on. The first owner was a disabled veteran who took great care of the car. The asking price is $25,900 or best offer. I am not trying to make any money off the car, just trying to avoid losses. To whoever is lucky enough to take this Jeep off my hands, I know you will love it as much as I did.
