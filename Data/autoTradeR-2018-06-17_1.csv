If comfort, space and reliability are high on your list of demands you need to stop looking at Jeeps in general and Wranglers specifically.However, if you want an adult toy that has been lovingly crafted to allow you to drive 4 hours to Tahoma (in relative comfort) and then head down its namesake then this is the rig for you. Pretty much ever modification to this Jeep has been done with a focus on function without entirely compromising its use as a daily driver.'But wait!' you say, 'If this Jeep is as awesome as you say then why would you sell it?' - 'Good question strawman I just invented'. Last July I got knocked off my Harley by an inattentive kid and lost the last 18 inches of my right leg. After no little practice I have been forced to the heartbreaking conclusion that manual transmissions are not terribly safe in my condition. So in the most literal sense, my loss is your gain.Details as follows:    Off Road Front Bumper     Warn M8000 Winch    LED Light Bar - Controlled using factory fog light switch.

I purchased this Jeep brand new at the end of 2015. It was used solely for marketing purposes. We put $6,700.00 of after market parts into it. The company I worked for at the time was paying for it so it was all decked out with company signage etc. I'm embarrassed to admit I have never even taken the Jeep 4x4ing and the hard top has never come off. The miles are all freeway / highway miles. This vehicle was only used for business and marketing purposes.The Mopar Steering Stabilizer makes highway / freeway rides unbelievably smooth even with the 2.5 inch lift kit.
