I purchased this Jeep brand new at the end of 2015. It was used solely for marketing purposes. We put $6,700.00 of after market parts into it. The company I worked for at the time was paying for it so it was all decked out with company signage etc. I'm embarrassed to admit I have never even taken the Jeep 4x4ing and the hard top has never come off. The miles are all freeway / highway miles. This vehicle was only used for business and marketing purposes.The Mopar Steering Stabilizer makes highway / freeway rides unbelievably smooth even with the 2.5 inch lift kit. I can only imagine how smooth this thing would ride 4X4ing with the lift and 35&quot; tires.

The car has been well maintained over that time (I still have all the service records). I have never had a major issue with the car. New tires put on it last year.Four wheel drive has been great in the snow or mud. In general, I have been really happy with the vehicle.The car also comes with a cover that helps keep it clean and take less abuse from the sun. I also have a rear rack that is great for hauling gear if you have 4 people in the car.

The only reason I am selling the car is that I will be moving, there is nothing wrong with the car at all it is basically new except for the fact that it has 8000 miles!!!! If you are looking for a great looking Suv/Truck with the capability to be an absolute beast off-road, this is the car for you!!!! You can take the doors and the roof off in the summer to enjoy the weather!! This jeep won the Putco Your Vehicle Contest for the best looking jeep!!!! Definitely turns heads especially with the Putco headlights which are one of the most powerful Led headlights you can buy and are made in America. I will also be including a mother black fender restorer because over time the fenders will fade and its always best to keep your jeep looking amazing!!! I am not willing to provide a lot of wiggle room on the price because this jeep has around 6,000 dollars in aftermarket parts and were all installed by professionals!!!Options and aftermarket parts-Pro-comp 2.5&quot; lift-Pro-comp 35&quot; tires-Pro-comp 17&quot; rims-Pro-comp Steering Stabilizer -SmittyBilt rock sliders-Putco Lumix Led Headlights-Aftermarket rearview camera-Jeep mats-Air conditioning-ABS-Stereo",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Unlimited Sport,2017,Used,Provo,Private,Automatic,1703,NA,NA

I've recently been accepted into law school and cannot see this sit in the garage for the next few years. I purchased this New in 2016 from Lakeshore Jeep Slidell, It was specifically ordered exactly the way I wanted it, white on white, with remote start, SAHARA (NOT SPORT). The Jeep was torn down at a local professional body shop the 1st week and every part was painted white(mirrors, handles, bumpers, interior pieces, grille, step side, tail lights, everything),it then went to another shop to get Fox lift kit 6.5&quot;.  Then it went to the wheel shop and got a set of (5) 24&quot;x12&quot; American Force polished wheels, with Toyo 37's.Then it went to the tint shop and got all 8 windows (including front) tinted with Ceramic. Then most importantly it went to gear shop to get 4.88 gears put in front and rear to handle the tires. Then it went to the leather shop and got upgraded custom made leather seats. There are too many small parts and pieces to list, but the Jeep was done right! Not an overly armored chopped impractical vehicle.  This stays garage kept, and has only seen rain maybe twice.  Doors have never even been off.  Never seen mud, Never sat outside more than 8 hours at a time.  This was not a daily, it was a weekend toy. I will be purchasing a new one after school and redoing this the same way.  It consistently gets compliments no matter where I go.  The system is a full alpine upgraded factory system with Sub mounted flush in the floor.

Nearly everything on this 2017 Jeep Wrangler Sahara was custom built and installed by the Jeep dealer. Fortunately, I was smart enough to keep all the original pieces to anything that was modified. You will obviously notice that everything cost a pretty penny and I didn t go the cheap route. Custom parts include Big 35  off road tires and rims, a new rugged edge bracket for the 5th wheel carrier, a beautiful custom hood, etc. I always envisioned in building a Jeep that has just the right touches to make it appear as beautiful as a Jeep can get. Custom Blood RED colored seats were designed, manufactured, and installed by the dealer. This Jeep has extremely low miles. Before you decide to purchase this JEEP, be prepared for all the head turns you asked for when driving a Jeep.

I ordered it straight from the factory as I wanted a manual with some options that most dealers seemed to only stock in the automatic form. It has the color matched hardtop as shown in the pictures and I also ordered the soft top for the summer. It was built with the optional Alpine speaker upgrade package. It has the brown leather seats with the front seats being heated. Being the Rubicon trim, it has the locking front and rear diffs. The rubicon trim also adds rock sliders and skid plates to the underbelly of the jeep as well as an electronic sway bar disconnect.Feel free to email me with any questions you may have. It has done a 22 mile commute (one way, 44 miles total daily) on upstate SC's i-85 since 2013 and has never left me stranded. It has been to snowshoe, West Virginia, Charleston, Charlotte, Atlanta, and numerous other places. It has been a good camping/ski trip car.

Has been maintained to include oil changes, tire rotations, differential lube , air filter, etc.  Comes with upgraded factory audio, soft and hard top, soft top window storage, soft top cover (When top is folded back) and standard air intake, etc.  I have never had any issues with it and it just had installed new brakes. (Talk about highway miles, brakes needed changed at 65k miles).  It has a couple minor dings but is in great shape and I always have people asking about it.  They even roll down windows at stop lights.  As the Jeep community knows, these vehicles last forever and retain their value.  This is an awesome vehicle so please, no low ball offers.

The frame-off restoration / conversion was completed by Cleveland Power and Performance in June 2015.  The engine and transmission are from a 2006 300C SRT8.  The engine was rebuilt during the conversion and has approximately 4,000 mile on it.It has a 6&quot; lift with Bilstein shocks / 35&quot; BF Goodrich All-Terrain tires and is nicely equipped with factory remote start, cruise control, navigation, hard top and all the other equipment you would expect in a Rubicon.  Since the conversion, I replaced the AC compressor with a genuine Mopar compressor, so the AC works perfect.  I also replaced the fuel tank with an updated genuine Mopar fuel tank - - as you know 2008 Wrangler?s have a problem with blowback when fueling.  Not this one!This Wrangler has a current PA inspection through July 2019.  This Wrangler needs nothing.  It's fun to drive and with 425hp / 420ft lbs torque; you can imagine how it goes!If you are serious about buying this Wrangler, contact me and I'll answer any questions you may have.  I am a private seller so this vehicle is being sold as-is with no warranty expressed or implied.  Feel free to bring your mechanic.  You wont be disappointed!  All the mechanics that have worked on it only have great things to say about the build.I have the title in hand.  It is a reconstructed PA title.  An Enhanced Safety Inspection was completed in 2015.  If you live in PA, you won't need to do this again.  This was a theft recovery vehicle with no structural damage.   It was found in a &quot;chop shop&quot; making it a perfect candidate for a frame-off / conversion.  I have the insurance pictures to show serious buyers - - you will see there was no body damage.  I also have about 100 pictures of the conversion too.Thanks for looking!",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Rubicon,2008,Used,Provo,Private,Automatic,1887,NA,NA

I special ordered the vehicle and got it April 2016. Perfect condition. Jeep has drastically changed the design of the jeep so you wont find another Willys in the JK style in this condition. The Willys Wheeler is closer to a Rubicon as far as its advanced rock climbing features and package. Has a ton more torque. The mud tires are awesome in snow, mud, and also on highway. The only &quot;mod I did was to remove the &quot;freedom panels&quot; (the roof above the drive and passenger that is a bit clumsy to remove and store) and install a flip top soft version. I ordered the premium stereo package with integrated weather proof subwoofer in the back frame. You can now open the from half of the roof at a stop light with one hand. I am moving across the country this summer and opted to buy a camper instead.

I purchased it in 2005 and it?s been a great vehicle for me. There was only one prior owner to me. It?s never been off-roading, I?ve mainly just driven it to and from work and around town and she deserves to make some mountain trips. It?s a manual, 5 speeds, 4L Sport. It?s been regularly maintained, and I recently had it aligned, tires rotated and filled, and put in a new steering wheel stock stabilizer (if you?re a jeep person you know jeeps get a little bumpy). It?s 4WD. A few years back I put a 3 ? in. Rubicon body lift on it as well as 33 ? 12 KO BF Goodrich tires (still in great condition). It has right around 153,500 miles, not bad for an 18 year old Jeep. It?s never been in an accident. In addition, I have a bikini top for the summer time should the next owner decide to take the top off (which is a hard top). I also have a cover for it when the top is off, which has 8 straps, one of which is broken but doesn?t seem to make a bit of difference and keeps the rain out when nice, cool summer thunderstorms pass through. I also installed a Kenwood deck (removable face), which had the option of CDs, a USB or an axillary plug in. She?s navy blue, black top (which has faded into a grey over the years).The cons, which are small, the windshield has a small crack in it and the driver seat has a little normal wear and tear on the side of the seat.

It does not shake or anything of the sort when driving at any speed. I have also recently added a Front Runner Jeep rack. This is the lightest and strongest rack on the market for Jeeps coming all the way from South Africa. It's completely configurable and is truly remarkable and can haul anything regardless of the size or shape. It currently has a lockable fishing pole/snowboard/ski holder on half of it which can easily be removed whenever you'd like. The front and rear bumpers are solid steel, with D-rings, and a fantastic Smittybilt wireless 10k lb winch. The interior is immaculate and has just been detailed. It's completely set up with a front light bar, and rear lights for illuminating the world behind you when need be (wildly helpful when camping, backing out in the dark, etc.) I custom installed light switches on the inside which blend smoothly and are very aesthetically pleasing compared to any I've seen. It is also ready to go with two more hookups already installed for whatever else you'd like to add to your toy.

He drives great with a lot of power and smooth transitions between gears and up hills. Ready for the open road, he?s seen a lot of street time but little past that.While Megraton wanted to play in the mountains, his owners never let him venture too far away from home. He has been driven easy and if you?re looking for a Jeep that has not been used and abused in the backcountry, than this one is for you. The interior is clean without any rips in the upholstery except for the driver?s seat left side. He is outfitted with the highest package available from the stereo, sound system, hauling package, leather seats, removal roof, and doors. He has an additional cargo holder top him for large cargo trips.Overall, he might be an older dog but can certainly learn new tricks and has a ton of more miles on him. In excellent condition, Megtron is looking for a new handler that will treat him right.SPECIFICATIONSVEHICLE TYPE: front-engine, 4-wheel-drive, 5-passenger, 4-door wagonENGINE TYPE: DOHC 24-valve V-6, aluminum block and heads, port fuel injectionKEY FEATURES? 4WD/AWD?

I am the second owner. I bought the Jeep back in 2015 and it has been great but with my son arriving I need more room with all the new baby gear. The Jeep has 119000 miles and counting since it is currently my daily car. It has a 4&quot; skyjacker lift kit on 35&quot; tires that have roughly 5000 miles on them. It has 4x4. The Jeep still has it stock gears. Also has fenders flares to allow for more clearance for the 35&quot; tires. The interior of the vehicle is a 9/10 still in great condition. The exterior is about a 7-8/10 the paint has some small scratches and two little dings you can hardly notice by the driver side door and one on the hood. The clear coat is starting to fade on the hood. But overall the Jeep is great. I'm looking to get close to what I owe on it but will to negotiate on the price.

First things:- Clear title in hand.- Frame is in fantastic shape; practically no rust - it's why I bought it in the first place. Things done to it:- Engine completely and professionally rebuilt. You can consider it new. Less than 100 miles on it. Currently has break-in oil in it.- Transmission recently professionally rebuilt and sealed with new synchronizers.- New (all five) oversize tires. 31X10.50R15 - custom wheels in perfect shape.- New suspension/springs/shocks/bushings all around. Steering aligned; no death wobble.- HEI distributor installed. New oil pump.- New brakes all around; new front rotors, new rear drums. New brake fluid.- New clutch, new clutch fluid.- New ball-joints, new front hubs/joints. New axle seals.- New differential oil.- New no-weld exhaust.- New gas tank/fuel pump/fuel lines/tank fill sensor.- Sport seats installed with 4-point seat belts.- It runs great. The carb is an aftermarket Weber 32/36 DGAV33B1. Things that are meh:- The carb was rebuilt, but could probably stand some fine-tuning. The HEI distributor doesn't like the vacuum advance, so that's disabled. A local carb shop tells me this is normal.- There is a 3-inch body lift on it, which messes a bit with the alignment of certain things which can be pointed out when we talk. Everything is fully functional though.- The soft-top could be better, but it works fine. Things that need work:- The middle dash is non-existent. I'm working on replacing it, but you might do better if you're into that sort of thing. I have a gauge cover, but not the cluster. I put a lot of effort into making things right with this Jeep.

Silver in color with dark charcoal interior.  The Jeep just had a new oil pan gasket installed by the dealership I bought it from.  Also had new tires put on it 4,000 miles ago.  I installed new spark plugs within the last 1,000 miles as well and changed the transmission fluid with full synthetic.  Jeep also has a new battery and magnaflow exhaust.    Has large aftermarket LED lights up on the bumper.  I believe the fender flares are aftermarket (they are wider than normal) but other than that, the Jeep is stock.  Doors are full doors.  Jeep has the stock stereo, cruise control, and heat/AC work great.   I have never taken this Jeep off the pavement.The Jeep drives great!  It s a blast to drive.  Changes in the family and the purchase of a new pickup truck have forced the sale.  I will definitely miss it.  The bad - while clay barring and waxing the Jeep I found some rust in the front left fender where dirt and crud had embedded between the actual fender and the fender flare and created an issue.  I removed the fender flare, removed the rust (good sheet metal under the rust), and applied POR-15.  This spot was about the size of a quarter and was not through the metal.  This Jeep is not a  rust bucket  but I am trying to disclose everything.  On cold startup it has the  Jeep tick  that goes away as it warms up.  I asked online and was told this is fairly common and just part of owning a Jeep, but I am disclosing it as I am not a mechanic and when I asked, people told me it s just a Jeep thing.  When the motor is cold it has a tick noise, as it warms it goes away.  Again, from what I was told this is quite common.  This is a VERY CLEAN Jeep.
