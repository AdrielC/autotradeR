The Elantra offers fashion-forward features like wraparound headlights, available front fog lights and a substantial wheelbase that gives it a lower, sportier profile. The smartly designed interior gives you more total space. In fact, the Elantra is so roomy, the government classifies it as a midsize car instead of a compact. Featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, the Elantra's available navigation system also includes a unique hidden rearview camera. This system also gives you the option of controlling the navigation, phone and audio via voice recognition. The available sunroof can turn the night sky into an entertainment option or the sunset into an ambient light source. You'll be impressed by a responsive 1.8L engine that features Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing (D-CVVT) which improves breathing on the intake, and exhaust camshafts to help lower emissions and provide better fuel economy.

An extensive standard features list and interior volume on par with some midsize sedans make the Elantra a great bargain. Source: KBB.com * Lots of features for the money; comfortable, quiet and well-built cabin; large trunk; long warranty coverage. Source: Edmunds * This year the Hyundai Elantra is back with a bit of a facelift along with a Coupe model and the Elantra GT, Hyundai's innovative evolution of the five-door hatchback. With Hyundai's Fluidic Sculpture design language, the Elantra bucks compact car convention in a big way. The car offers fashion-forward features like wraparound headlights, available front fog lights and a substantial wheelbase that gives it a lower, sportier profile. The Elantra doesn't just boast the most front leg room in its class, the smartly designed interior gives you more total space. In fact, the Elantra is so roomy, the government classifies it as a midsize car instead of a compact. Featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, the Elantra's available navigation system also includes a unique hidden rearview camera. This system also gives you the option of controlling the navigation, phone and audio via voice recognition. The available sunroof can turn the night sky into an entertainment option or the sunset into an ambient light source. You'll be impressed by a responsive 1.8L engine that features Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing (D-CVVT) which improves breathing on the intake, and exhaust camshafts to help lower emissions and provide better fuel economy.

Source: Edmunds  * If you're looking for a compact car with character and comfort, but you don't want to pay an arm and a leg, check out the 2014 Hyundai Elantra. An extensive standard features list and interior volume on par with some midsize sedans make the Elantra a great bargain. Source: KBB.com  * This year the Hyundai Elantra is back with a bit of a facelift along with a Coupe model and the Elantra GT, Hyundai's innovative evolution of the five-door hatchback. With Hyundai's Fluidic Sculpture design language, the Elantra bucks compact car convention in a big way. The car offers fashion-forward features like wraparound headlights, available front fog lights and a substantial wheelbase that gives it a lower, sportier profile. The Elantra doesn't just boast the most front leg room in its class, the smartly designed interior gives you more total space. In fact, the Elantra is so roomy, the government classifies it as a midsize car instead of a compact. Featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, the Elantra's available navigation system also includes a unique hidden rearview camera. This system also gives you the option of controlling the navigation, phone and audio via voice recognition. The available sunroof can turn the night sky into an entertainment option or the sunset into an ambient light source.

Source: Edmunds* With Hyundai's Fluidic Sculpture design language, the Elantra bucks compact car convention in a big way. Choose from 3 different body styles to including sedan, coupe, and hatchback. The Elantra offers fashion-forward features like wraparound headlights, available front fog lights and a substantial wheelbase that gives it a lower, sportier profile. The smartly designed interior gives you more total space. In fact, the Elantra is so roomy, the government classifies it as a midsize car instead of a compact. Featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, the Elantra's available navigation system also includes a unique hidden rearview camera. This system also gives you the option of controlling the navigation, phone and audio via voice recognition. The available sunroof can turn the night sky into an entertainment option or the sunset into an ambient light source. You'll be impressed by a responsive 1.8L engine that features Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing (D-CVVT) which improves breathing on the intake, and exhaust camshafts to help lower emissions and provide better fuel econ>","5 Years/60,000 Miles","10 Years/100,000 Miles",7 Years/Unlimited Miles,5 Years/Unlimited Miles,FALSE,Dennis Dillon Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram,SE,2015,Used,Provo,Dealer,NA,1934,NA,NA

Source: Edmunds* With Hyundai's Fluidic Sculpture design language, the Elantra bucks compact car convention in a big way. Choose from 3 different body styles to including sedan, coupe, and hatchback. The Elantra offers fashion-forward features like wraparound headlights, available front fog lights and a substantial wheelbase that gives it a lower, sportier profile. The smartly designed interior gives you more total space. In fact, the Elantra is so roomy, the government classifies it as a midsize car instead of a compact. Featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, the Elantra's available navigation system also includes a unique hidden rearview camera. This system also gives you the option of controlling the navigation, phone and audio via voice recognition. The available sunroof can turn the night sky into an entertainment option or the sunset into an ambient light source.

Source: Edmunds* The 2015 Hyundai Elantra offers up the style and sophistication of a more expensive car, while still remaining a bargain, proving that you don't have to pay an arm and a leg just to have stylish, feature-laden transportation. Source: KBB.com* With Hyundai's Fluidic Sculpture design language, the Elantra bucks compact car convention in a big way. Choose from 3 different body styles to including sedan, coupe, and hatchback. The Elantra offers fashion-forward features like wraparound headlights, available front fog lights and a substantial wheelbase that gives it a lower, sportier profile. The smartly designed interior gives you more total space. In fact, the Elantra is so roomy, the government classifies it as a midsize car instead of a compact. Featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, the Elantra's available navigation system also includes a unique hidden rearview camera. This system also gives you the option of controlling the navigation, phone and audio via voice recognition. The available sunroof can turn the night sky into an entertainment option or the sunset into an ambient light source. You'll be impressed by a responsive 1.8L engine that features Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing (D-CVVT) which improves breathing on the intake, and exhaust camshafts to help lower emissions and provide better fuel economy. With up to an EPA-estimated 38 MPG Hwy, 145-hp, and plenty of standard features in a sporty package it's sure to attract a huge fan base. A sweet-shifting 6-speed manual is standard. The available 6-speed automatic transmission with SHIFTRONIC has a lock-up torque converter for higher fuel economy at freeway speeds.

An extensive standard features list and interior volume on par with some midsize sedans make the Elantra a great bargain. Source: KBB.com  * This year the Hyundai Elantra is back with a bit of a facelift along with a Coupe model and the Elantra GT, Hyundai's innovative evolution of the five-door hatchback. With Hyundai's Fluidic Sculpture design language, the Elantra bucks compact car convention in a big way. The car offers fashion-forward features like wraparound headlights, available front fog lights and a substantial wheelbase that gives it a lower, sportier profile. The Elantra doesn't just boast the most front leg room in its class, the smartly designed interior gives you more total space. In fact, the Elantra is so roomy, the government classifies it as a midsize car instead of a compact. Featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, the Elantra's available navigation system also includes a unique hidden rearview camera. This system also gives you the option of controlling the navigation, phone and audio via voice recognition.

More information about the 2017 Hyundai Elantra: The Elantra competes with other compact cars such as the Toyota Corolla, the Ford Focus and the Honda Civic in one of the most competitive segments in the United States. With so much competition, prices are kept relatively low despite every manufacturer trying to outdo one another with their features and amenities.

Source: Edmunds  * With Hyundai's Fluidic Sculpture design language, the Elantra bucks compact car convention in a big way. Choose from 3 different body styles to including sedan, coupe, and hatchback. The Elantra offers fashion-forward features like wraparound headlights, available front fog lights and a substantial wheelbase that gives it a lower, sportier profile. The smartly designed interior gives you more total space. In fact, the Elantra is so roomy, the government classifies it as a midsize car instead of a compact. Featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, the Elantra's available navigation system also includes a unique hidden rearview camera. This system also gives you the option of controlling the navigation, phone and audio via voice recognition. The available sunroof can turn the night sky into an entertainment option or the sunset into an ambient light source. You'll be impressed by a responsive 1.8L engine that features Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing (D-CVVT) which improves breathin","5 Years/60,000 Miles","10 Years/100,000 Miles",7 Years/Unlimited Miles,5 Years/Unlimited Miles,FALSE,Horne Mazda,SE,2015,Used,Provo,Dealer,Automatic,1856,24,35
