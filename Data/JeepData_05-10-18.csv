While a trail-rated, six-speed, two-door, soft-top Jeep is awesome for dirt roads, snow, and summer drives with the top down, it is not great for child seats, infants, or wives who find it hard to shift and waive a rattle around.  So, the new kid is in, and my Wrangler is out.I bought this Jeep new in 2007.  I actually ordered it from the factory while I was deployed with the U.S. Army in 2006.  I had dreams of lifting it, slapping on some big, bad tires, and taking it off road.  As you can see from the photos, that never happened.  It s pretty much still stock, and it has rarely felt anything but pavement.  It has an after-market Pioneer stereo (iPhone hookup and Bluetooth) to go with the factory-upgraded Infinity speakers and subwoofer.  Clean CARFAX.I did your comparison shopping for you (but you should still do your own research), and here s what I found: Jeeps like this list around $12,900.  Those Jeeps have better wheels and newer tops.  They typically have higher miles, and they don t have the upgraded speakers.  Wear and tear is similar.  My Jeep has a golf ball size dent in the passenger door, and I ve worn out the steering wheel and floor.  Apparently, I ve put my hand and heel in the same spots everyday for the last ten years.

Comes with Sport Package 23B featuring A/C, Freedom Top black 3 piece hard top w/t-top storage bag & other goodies (see last scan for window sticker). The price of the Jeep new pre- tax with these options was $26,475. In addition, the original owner (I'm the 2nd) added running boards, front Weather Tech mats & 5 new wheels & tires from a Jeep Rubicon. The tires have very little wear (spare is unused) & are BF Goodrich Mud Terrain T/A's (LT255/75R17). The Freedom Top can be removed or used as a T-Top without removing the entire top.It's like getting a new Jeep Wrangler Sport with Rubicon elements at a discount. The only glitch is the tire pressure warning light stays on because of the difference in the larger Rubicon tires vs the standard Wrangler tires. I was told this can be adjusted at most Jeep dealerships, but it never was an issue with me. Speaking of Jeep dealerships, I believe the 5 year or 100,000 mile Powertrain/Roadside Assistance Limited Warranty goes with the vehicle (possible transfer fee). Bonus: This was the last year of the 100,000 Mile Warranty. Since the Jeep was first registered on 07-28-15, there may be several months left on the 3 year or 36K mile Basic Limited Warranty. Seems logical but I can't guarantee it. The reason I'm letting this great Jeep Wrangler go is because from day one my older Collie couldn't jump up in the back. Thus the Jeep has sat in my garage, getting very little use. The top has never been off & the Jeep has never been off-road. It comes with 2 ignition/door keys, a Jeep tool kit, document holder, the original Owner's Manual/User Guide & all records.Shipping arrangements & fees are the responsibility of the buyer.

I'm selling the family Jeep. Was my old mans, bought it new in 2002, I picked it up in 2012 and started to go to work. With a little over 90k original miles, this Jeep is clean, built for any weekend getaway, and cruises comfortably on the freeway. Maintenance, Nothing is deferred. This beautiful thing is at home on any overland trail, or running 75 up the 395. It's had quite a few upgrades since I picked it up. There's probably more, but here goes...First I added a new Bestop black sailcloth softop. Then I upgraded to the full doors. From there is where the fun stuff started happening: connected with metalcloak and got the full overline removable fenders, aluminum corner guards, and steel rock rails. Oh, and I added the aluminum inner fender wells also. All of these are powder coated by embee. White is body color and grey around the edges. Kept the stock height and increased the spring weight thanks to Deaver springs for some custom coils for the added steel and bumpers. Finished that off with some ultra wheels and Goodyear Kevlar MTR's and a set of bilstein 5100 shocks. Rides smooth! From there I went to LOD and picked up the rear bumper, tire carrier, rotopax and highlift mounts with trail basket. Went all LED with truck-lites, and Genright tail lights. Added 4 rigid cubes, two on the A pillar and two in the rear wired to OEM dash switches and a rigid 10?lightbar on the poison spyder front bumper. Changed over the brakes to black magic setup, rotors, pads, etc. rebuilt the transmission with HD plates, and a shift kit. Banks engineering added intake, headers, exhaust, and programmer- all dyno?d By banks. Full stereo upgrade with for gate Amp and kicker speakers, bestop waterproof seat covers front and rear, added spiderwebshade Bimini, poison spider hood louvers, an HD alternator, new radiator, and much  Jeep is a great daily driver and capable of 2000 mi. Trips loaded down for camping. Let me know what questions you have!",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Sahara,2002,Used,Provo,NA,NA,Private

If you have a real need for all-season capability, 4-Doors, or simply a strong desire to depart the beaten path, my 2012 Jeep Wrangler is a tough recipe to beat. I've maintained her well and only put 52K miles on her in 6 years, she's basically a new car, never had an accident and never broken down. Under the hood sits a powerful 3.6 liter V6 that produces 285 horsepower and almost as much torque. Combined with the rock-solid Dana front and rear axles, this 5-Speed automatic transmission will allow you to maintain civility or allow you to carve your own path where ever you see fit thanks to the locking differentials, Rock-Trac HD transfer case, and gas charged. This jeep goes beyond basic by offering Air Conditioning, 4 wheel drive, power windows/locks, and special badging. With city streets and freeways providing an increasingly unfriendly atmosphere to standard, car-based suspension and real ground clearance are increasingly handy for the committed urbanite. If you get the urge to take an open-air cruise, just remove the top, put on some shades, crank up the Infinity sound system, and hit the road! A strong safety cage surrounds you, multi stage airbags protect you, and Hill-start and stability control help you along the way. My arctic offers all of the legendary rock-climbing ability of America's favorite off-roader, with a dose of comfort to go along for the ride!-This is $3K below market value-She's been meticulously detailed-No off roading, ever -Inspected and given a full fluid refresh and certification by dealership of perfect mechanical conditionWhy I am selling her: I moved to Seattle from Texas in 2014 and rarely ever drive her, hence why she has 52K miles in just 6 years. I work from home and Seattle is a smaller city that I can easily navigate on foot, she sits in the garage and is useful when I have family in town a few times a year.",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Arctic,2012,Used,Provo,NA,NA,Private

I've recently been accepted into law school and cannot see this sit in the garage for the next few years. I purchased this New in 2016 from Lakeshore Jeep Slidell, It was specifically ordered exactly the way I wanted it, white on white, with remote start, SAHARA (NOT SPORT). The Jeep was torn down at a local professional body shop the 1st week and every part was painted white(mirrors, handles, bumpers, interior pieces, grille, step side, tail lights, everything),it then went to another shop to get Fox lift kit 6.5&quot;.  Then it went to the wheel shop and got a set of (5) 24&quot;x12&quot; American Force polished wheels, with Toyo 37's.Then it went to the tint shop and got all 8 windows (including front) tinted with Ceramic. Then most importantly it went to gear shop to get 4.88 gears put in front and rear to handle the tires. Then it went to the leather shop and got upgraded custom made leather seats. There are too many small parts and pieces to list, but the Jeep was done right! Not an overly armored chopped impractical vehicle.  This stays garage kept, and has only seen rain maybe twice.  Doors have never even been off.  Never seen mud, Never sat outside more than 8 hours at a time.  This was not a daily, it was a weekend toy. I will be purchasing a new one after school and redoing this the same way.  It consistently gets compliments no matter where I go.  The system is a full alpine upgraded factory system with Sub mounted flush in the floor. The headunit is an android tablet that has internet etc.IT sounds AMAZING!!! , A/C ice cold, All scheduled maintenance, All records, Always garaged, Custom paint/ Custom wheels, GPS system, Fully loaded with all the goodies,New tires, No accidents, Non-smoker, One owner, Perfect first car, Satellite radio, Seats like new, Still under factory warranty, A MUST SEE VEHICLE.

The Willys Wheeler is closer to a Rubicon as far as its advanced rock climbing features and package. Has a ton more torque. The mud tires are awesome in snow, mud, and also on highway. The only &quot;mod I did was to remove the &quot;freedom panels&quot; (the roof above the drive and passenger that is a bit clumsy to remove and store) and install a flip top soft version. I ordered the premium stereo package with integrated weather proof subwoofer in the back frame. You can now open the from half of the roof at a stop light with one hand.

I just moved back to Texas from Colorado where I built this Jeep to tackle anything nature could throw at it. I've put more than 15k into it, upgraded all the items to handle the larger suspension and larger tires, all the way from the suspension to the hinge of the tailgate. It does not shake or anything of the sort when driving at any speed. I have also recently added a Front Runner Jeep rack. This is the lightest and strongest rack on the market for Jeeps coming all the way from South Africa. It's completely configurable and is truly remarkable and can haul anything regardless of the size or shape. It currently has a lockable fishing pole/snowboard/ski holder on half of it which can easily be removed whenever you'd like. The front and rear bumpers are solid steel, with D-rings, and a fantastic Smittybilt wireless 10k lb winch. The interior is immaculate and has just been detailed. It's completely set up with a front light bar, and rear lights for illuminating the world behind you when need be (wildly helpful when camping, backing out in the dark, etc.) I custom installed light switches on the inside which blend smoothly and are very aesthetically pleasing compared to any I've seen. It is also ready to go with two more hookups already installed for whatever else you'd like to add to your toy. Not shown, I also have a tonneau cover, foot pegs for when the doors off for all 4 doors, and many other fun add-ons. I'm sure I missed a ton of things when writing this, please let me know if you have any questions at all.A/C ice cold, All scheduled maintenance, Custom wheels, Excellent condition, Fully loaded with all the goodies, Looks & drives great, Mostly highway miles, Must see, No accidents, Non-smoker, One owner, Satellite radio, Seats like new, Upgraded sound system, Very clean interior, Well maintained",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Used 2014 Jeep Wrangler,2014,Used,Provo,NA,NA,Private

He drives great with a lot of power and smooth transitions between gears and up hills. Ready for the open road, he?s seen a lot of street time but little past that.While Megraton wanted to play in the mountains, his owners never let him venture too far away from home. He has been driven easy and if you?re looking for a Jeep that has not been used and abused in the backcountry, than this one is for you. The interior is clean without any rips in the upholstery except for the driver?s seat left side. He is outfitted with the highest package available from the stereo, sound system, hauling package, leather seats, removal roof, and doors. He has an additional cargo holder top him for large cargo trips.Overall, he might be an older dog but can certainly learn new tricks and has a ton of more miles on him. In excellent condition, Megtron is looking for a new handler that will treat him right.SPECIFICATIONSVEHICLE TYPE: front-engine, 4-wheel-drive, 5-passenger, 4-door wagonENGINE TYPE: DOHC 24-valve V-6, aluminum block and heads, port fuel injectionKEY FEATURES? 4WD/AWD?

I am the second owner. I bought the Jeep back in 2015 and it has been great but with my son arriving I need more room with all the new baby gear. The Jeep has 119000 miles and counting since it is currently my daily car. It has a 4&quot; skyjacker lift kit on 35&quot; tires that have roughly 5000 miles on them. It has 4x4. The Jeep still has it stock gears. Also has fenders flares to allow for more clearance for the 35&quot; tires. The interior of the vehicle is a 9/10 still in great condition. The exterior is about a 7-8/10 the paint has some small scratches and two little dings you can hardly notice by the driver side door and one on the hood. The clear coat is starting to fade on the hood. But overall the Jeep is great. I'm looking to get close to what I owe on it but will to negotiate on the price.

You can consider it new. Less than 100 miles on it. Currently has break-in oil in it.- Transmission recently professionally rebuilt and sealed with new synchronizers.- New (all five) oversize tires. 31X10.50R15 - custom wheels in perfect shape.- New suspension/springs/shocks/bushings all around. Steering aligned; no death wobble.- HEI distributor installed. New oil pump.- New brakes all around; new front rotors, new rear drums. New brake fluid.- New clutch, new clutch fluid.- New ball-joints, new front hubs/joints. New axle seals.- New differential oil.- New no-weld exhaust.- New gas tank/fuel pump/fuel lines/tank fill sensor.- Sport seats installed with 4-point seat belts.- It runs great. The carb is an aftermarket Weber 32/36 DGAV33B1.Things that are meh:- The carb was rebuilt, but could probably stand some fine-tuning. The HEI distributor doesn't like the vacuum advance, so that's disabled. A local carb shop tells me this is normal.- There is a 3-inch body lift on it, which messes a bit with the alignment of certain things which can be pointed out when we talk. Everything is fully functional though.- The soft-top could be better, but it works fine.Things that need work:- The middle dash is non-existent. I'm working on replacing it, but you might do better if you're into that sort of thing. I have a gauge cover, but not the cluster.I put a lot of effort into making things right with this Jeep.

Silver in color with dark charcoal interior.  The Jeep just had a new oil pan gasket installed by the dealership I bought it from.  Also had new tires put on it 4,000 miles ago.  I installed new spark plugs within the last 1,000 miles as well and changed the transmission fluid with full synthetic.  Jeep also has a new battery and magnaflow exhaust.    Has large aftermarket LED lights up on the bumper.  I believe the fender flares are aftermarket (they are wider than normal) but other than that, the Jeep is stock.  Doors are full doors.  Jeep has the stock stereo, cruise control, and heat/AC work great.   I have never taken this Jeep off the pavement.The Jeep drives great!  It s a blast to drive.  Changes in the family and the purchase of a new pickup truck have forced the sale.  I will definitely miss it.  The bad - while clay barring and waxing the Jeep I found some rust in the front left fender where dirt and crud had embedded between the actual fender and the fender flare and created an issue.  I removed the fender flare, removed the rust (good sheet metal under the rust), and applied POR-15.  This spot was about the size of a quarter and was not through the metal.  This Jeep is not a  rust bucket  but I am trying to disclose everything.  On cold startup it has the  Jeep tick  that goes away as it warms up.  I asked online and was told this is fairly common and just part of owning a Jeep, but I am disclosing it as I am not a mechanic and when I asked, people told me it s just a Jeep thing.  When the motor is cold it has a tick noise, as it warms it goes away.  Again, from what I was told this is quite common.  This is a VERY CLEAN Jeep.
