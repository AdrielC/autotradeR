While a trail-rated, six-speed, two-door, soft-top Jeep is awesome for dirt roads, snow, and summer drives with the top down, it is not great for child seats, infants, or wives who find it hard to shift and waive a rattle around.  So, the new kid is in, and my Wrangler is out.I bought this Jeep new in 2007.  I actually ordered it from the factory while I was deployed with the U.S. Army in 2006.  I had dreams of lifting it, slapping on some big, bad tires, and taking it off road.  As you can see from the photos, that never happened.  It s pretty much still stock, and it has rarely felt anything but pavement.  It has an after-market Pioneer stereo (iPhone hookup and Bluetooth) to go with the factory-upgraded Infinity speakers and subwoofer.  Clean CARFAX.I did your comparison shopping for you (but you should still do your own research), and here s what I found: Jeeps like this list around $12,900.  Those Jeeps have better wheels and newer tops.  They typically have higher miles, and they don t have the upgraded speakers.  Wear and tear is similar.  My Jeep has a golf ball size dent in the passenger door, and I ve worn out the steering wheel and floor.  Apparently, I ve put my hand and heel in the same spots everyday for the last ten years.  You can t Jeep Waive from anywhere else, though.  (If you re not going to Jeep Waive, don t call.)  There s a red one in Colorado Springs for $10,500 with 116,000 miles and a hard top.

New tires put on it last year.Four wheel drive has been great in the snow or mud. In general, I have been really happy with the vehicle.The car also comes with a cover that helps keep it clean and take less abuse from the sun. I also have a rear rack that is great for hauling gear if you have 4 people in the car.

Comes with Sport Package 23B featuring A/C, Freedom Top black 3 piece hard top w/t-top storage bag & other goodies (see last scan for window sticker). The price of the Jeep new pre- tax with these options was $26,475. In addition, the original owner (I'm the 2nd) added running boards, front Weather Tech mats & 5 new wheels & tires from a Jeep Rubicon. The tires have very little wear (spare is unused) & are BF Goodrich Mud Terrain T/A's (LT255/75R17). The Freedom Top can be removed or used as a T-Top without removing the entire top.It's like getting a new Jeep Wrangler Sport with Rubicon elements at a discount. The only glitch is the tire pressure warning light stays on because of the difference in the larger Rubicon tires vs the standard Wrangler tires. I was told this can be adjusted at most Jeep dealerships, but it never was an issue with me. Speaking of Jeep dealerships, I believe the 5 year or 100,000 mile Powertrain/Roadside Assistance Limited Warranty goes with the vehicle (possible transfer fee). Bonus: This was the last year of the 100,000 Mile Warranty. Since the Jeep was first registered on 07-28-15, there may be several months left on the 3 year or 36K mile Basic Limited Warranty. Seems logical but I can't guarantee it. The reason I'm letting this great Jeep Wrangler go is because from day one my older Collie couldn't jump up in the back. Thus the Jeep has sat in my garage, getting very little use. The top has never been off & the Jeep has never been off-road. It comes with 2 ignition/door keys, a Jeep tool kit, document holder, the original Owner's Manual/User Guide & all records.Shipping arrangements & fees are the responsibility of the buyer.

I'm selling the family Jeep. Was my old mans, bought it new in 2002, I picked it up in 2012 and started to go to work. With a little over 90k original miles, this Jeep is clean, built for any weekend getaway, and cruises comfortably on the freeway. Maintenance, Nothing is deferred. This beautiful thing is at home on any overland trail, or running 75 up the 395. It's had quite a few upgrades since I picked it up. There's probably more, but here goes...First I added a new Bestop black sailcloth softop. Then I upgraded to the full doors. From there is where the fun stuff started happening: connected with metalcloak and got the full overline removable fenders, aluminum corner guards, and steel rock rails. Oh, and I added the aluminum inner fender wells also. All of these are powder coated by embee. White is body color and grey around the edges. Kept the stock height and increased the spring weight thanks to Deaver springs for some custom coils for the added steel and bumpers. Finished that off with some ultra wheels and Goodyear Kevlar MTR's and a set of bilstein 5100 shocks. Rides smooth! From there I went to LOD and picked up the rear bumper, tire carrier, rotopax and highlift mounts with trail basket. Went all LED with truck-lites, and Genright tail lights. Added 4 rigid cubes, two on the A pillar and two in the rear wired to OEM dash switches and a rigid 10?lightbar on the poison spyder front bumper. Changed over the brakes to black magic setup, rotors, pads, etc. rebuilt the transmission with HD plates, and a shift kit. Banks engineering added intake, headers, exhaust, and programmer- all dyno?d By banks. Full stereo upgrade with for gate Amp and kicker speakers, bestop waterproof seat covers front and rear, added spiderwebshade Bimini, poison spider hood louvers, an HD alternator, new radiator, and much  Jeep is a great daily driver and capable of 2000 mi.

If you have a real need for all-season capability, 4-Doors, or simply a strong desire to depart the beaten path, my 2012 Jeep Wrangler is a tough recipe to beat. I've maintained her well and only put 52K miles on her in 6 years, she's basically a new car, never had an accident and never broken down. Under the hood sits a powerful 3.6 liter V6 that produces 285 horsepower and almost as much torque. Combined with the rock-solid Dana front and rear axles, this 5-Speed automatic transmission will allow you to maintain civility or allow you to carve your own path where ever you see fit thanks to the locking differentials, Rock-Trac HD transfer case, and gas charged. This jeep goes beyond basic by offering Air Conditioning, 4 wheel drive, power windows/locks, and special badging. With city streets and freeways providing an increasingly unfriendly atmosphere to standard, car-based suspension and real ground clearance are increasingly handy for the committed urbanite.

I live in the south so it's never been driven in the snow.  I'm a non-smoker and have no pets.  I've had all oil changes, tire rotations, and additional maintenance performed at recommended intervals.  It has never been involved in an accident and has never had any body work or alterations to the factory equipment.  I have it professionally detailed once a month and waxed twice a year.  It has never been through an automatic car wash.  The wheels are in pristine condition and have never been rubbed against a curb.  The tires were replaced around 55,000 miles so they have about 35,000 miles on them.  There is still plenty of tread left and I expect they'd be fine for at least another 20,000 miles.  Exterior is in like-new condition with no scratches, dings, etc. and the interior is very clean.  It comes with factory carpet floor mats and Jeep brand rubber floor/cargo mats.

If you re looking up CJ7s I ll assume your aware of most of the features and all the Jeep has to offer. I can t honestly say this is one of the Cleanest CJ7s on the market right now. Jeep is a 5 speed manual. I bought the Jeep from the original owner 4- years ago (Shipped from Cali to NJ). I have a copy of the original title to prove this. As you re aware the Laredo was the Top of the Line CJ7 they offered and this one comes with Factory Air, Hard Top and Doors, Soft Top and Doors, and I think a Bikini top (I ll have to check). From my understanding the Jeep is ALL Original and EVERYTHING works as it did in 1985 (yes, the Clock still works too). I did have the Jeep re-painted and put on new decals and new Stainless Steel on the Exterior. The interior appears to have the Original Carpet! There is ZERO Rust on the Jeep (big reason why I bought a Jeep sight unseen from California). I put in $3500 worth of tune ups and repairs to whatever was needed the first month I had it   the Jeep now has a Brand-New Set of 31  BF Goodrich tires (with less than 200 miles on them). Why am I selling? Well I put on 3,000 miles in the 4-years I had the Jeep  so I obviously don t drive it much at all and the Jeep just sits in my garage. I have twin 4-year old daughters   so a CJ7 is not ideal to throw them in the back seat! A CJ7 is one of the only cars where you can buy   drive for a few years   then sell it at same price you got it for!! This is my 3rd CJ7 and yes, I will miss this dearly!

Just this month finished the long term restoration.   Interior and exterior every single piece is either brand new or fully restored.  Only 20 miles driven since completion.   All new Bestop seats and soft top.  The color is Range Rover Bourneville Brown.  In the dark it looks black but in the sun it glistens metallic brown and is an absolute head turner.    New wheels, new tires, new top, new gauges, new lights, new hardware, new soft goods, new chrome, new bumpers, new fenders, new stainless steel, new seat belts.......everything is new.   The interior is rhino lined and painted.   All former rust was cut out and new panels welded in where needed.  It is showroom spotless.   The transmission has 1,100 miles on it.  New exhaust system four years ago.  Wheels and tires have zero miles.  It tracks straight and runs smooth.        As for the engine and engine compartment it is original and maintained well.  It is strong and I continue to leave it as is since it is so strong.   I have many pictures that show the details of the restoration which took many months and they clearly show the level of detail.     The Jeep is very unique yet conservative in the way it presents as regards color and accessories.     In addition I will include crates of spares as well as chrome nerf bars that we did not install.   Also I have a besttop convertible top that I will include - the metal hardware was stripped and repainted.   Also I still have two black seats that are same as the Trailmax seats but a different brand in boxes that I will include.  They are slightly used.   I only removed them and replaced with tan ones to make the colors match.  I am in south Florida having just moved here from up north where Jeep lived from new until 2016, Many files and documentation and records available.

Silver in color with dark charcoal interior.  The Jeep just had a new oil pan gasket installed by the dealership I bought it from.  Also had new tires put on it 4,000 miles ago.  I installed new spark plugs within the last 1,000 miles as well and changed the transmission fluid with full synthetic.  Jeep also has a new battery and magnaflow exhaust.    Has large aftermarket LED lights up on the bumper.  I believe the fender flares are aftermarket (they are wider than normal) but other than that, the Jeep is stock.  Doors are full doors.  Jeep has the stock stereo, cruise control, and heat/AC work great.   I have never taken this Jeep off the pavement.The Jeep drives great!  It s a blast to drive.  Changes in the family and the purchase of a new pickup truck have forced the sale.  I will definitely miss it.  The bad - while clay barring and waxing the Jeep I found some rust in the front left fender where dirt and crud had embedded between the actual fender and the fender flare and created an issue.  I removed the fender flare, removed the rust (good sheet metal under the rust), and applied POR-15.  This spot was about the size of a quarter and was not through the metal.  This Jeep is not a  rust bucket  but I am trying to disclose everything.  On cold startup it has the  Jeep tick  that goes away as it warms up.  I asked online and was told this is fairly common and just part of owning a Jeep, but I am disclosing it as I am not a mechanic and when I asked, people told me it s just a Jeep thing.  When the motor is cold it has a tick noise, as it warms it goes away.  Again, from what I was told this is quite common.  This is a VERY CLEAN Jeep.

The moonroof is a great feature, and it has the ability to access the hatch through the glass, without having to open the whole hatch, which is great for loading and quick access!More Details:There is one very small, almost unnoticeable spot on the rear where the previous owner backed into something, but it was repainted with MOPAR paint and sealed with MOPAR-provided clear coat. But this does have the Laredo E-Group, which includes great features like remote start, Bluetooth connectivity, etc. Additionally, it has a 120V power inverter, which combined with the three cigarette lighters plugins, is great for long road trips! You can run all sorts of things for your backseat passengers. Since we have owned it, it has always had prompt maintenance at MOPAR dealerships. I have most of the service records that I can include with the vehicle. Payment:Certified check or money order, please.

Therefore, this Jeep still has over 57,000 miles left on that warranty.Additional Info:KBB &quot;Good&quot; Market Value range - $16,207 to $18,014Some additional features are:heated steering wheel (amazing)Power lift gate/trunkdriver seat has automatic controls as wellFog lightsRemote startKeyless Start (never have to take keys out of pocket/purse)",NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Private Seller,Latitude,NA,2015,Used,Provo,Private,NA,NA

Axles have only 8000 total miles on them.This Jeep is set up for serious off-road capability combined with good on-road driving manners. It has a well-tuned suspension, strong axles, proper gearing, front & rear lockers, high ground clearance, and tough underbody protection, yet you could drive it hours down the highway or every day to work without worries.One quirk however is that due to the design of lockers, the rear axle can occasionally bind, then release during tight turns on dry pavement .The bind makes the tires 'chirp' and the release makes a bang. This only happens occasionally and is due to the roller clutch design used for the locking function in these differentials. To confirm there's nothing actually wrong, I've had the differential examined by a certified tech and they found no issues and the wear patterns on the ring and pinions are fine.AVAILABLE EXTRAS: I have a ton of spare parts for this Jeep, locker parts, tow bar that attaches to custom bumper, spare suspensions parts, etc. I have a FULL SIZE 35&quot; mounted spare tire.

He had recently installed a small body lift and new Mickey Thompson wheels and tires (5- 33x12.5).  It has a factory hard top which makes it even more rare as most LJ's were a soft top.  Jeep only produced the LJ Rubicon for 2 years and only made a total of 12,596 of them.  The Unlimited is 15&quot; longer, has more leg room in the back seat, has 1500 lbs more tow capacity than the TJ for a total of 3500, and rides and drives much better than the TJ.

The listed vehicle is a 2006 Jeep Rubicon. Here's a story about how I've owned it (Over a year now)I bought this car on Autotrader from a guy out in California who said this drove like a Cadillac. I had my cousin confirm it. I shipped it to Ohio to realize it was a monster truck of a Cadillac.The car was hardly driven for 10 years. It's main purpose was for off roading. I needed something to drive at higher speeds though. So, since I've owned the vehicle, I have lowered the lift by half (6 to 3 inches) putting brand new brackets on & suspension & 5 new tires. I still need to replace the windshield, but In the meantime, my current asking price reflects the current value I believe the vehicle is worth. The car is my baby & I practically wash it every 3 days. Only text me if you're serious. I bought this car for $24,000 & had to put another $5,000 in it. There is little wiggle room. The jeep is more favorable getting dirty on a trail then on the highway in luxury FYI. Enthused Jeep drivers only.

It has been reliable.  I recently had some 120,000 mile service done and also replaced the clutch system components.  I have taken good care of the Jeep, and I have depended on it for my daily drive.  It is also great for a weekend trail ride with the top off or with the freedom panels removed.  The 4 doors makes it easy to bring the family along. This Jeep is stock except I added a custom metal front bumper with front hitch.  I also added some wiring and connector for a hitch mounted portable winch.  The Rubicon is the best Jeep for stock off-road capabilities and  includes a electronic disconnecting front sway bar, locking differentials/axles both front and rear.
