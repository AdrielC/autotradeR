Please inquire for more information on this 2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport. The CARFAX report for this 2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport highlights that it's a One-Owner vehicle, and for good reason. A One-Owner vehicle gives you the feel of owning a new vehicle without paying the new car price. This Jeep Wrangler Unlimited offers all the comforts of a well-optioned sedan with the utility you demand from an SUV. This vehicle comes with 4WD for better traction on unstable surfaces, like snow and dirt to give you the edge over anything you might encounter on the road. Rare is the vehicle that has been driven so gently and maintained so meticulously as this pre-owned beauty. Some vehicles are more of a need-to-have. This one is a absolutely-must-have. If it's looks aren't enough to persuade you, the feel of the powerhouse under the hood most definitely will. More information about the 2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited: With prices starting at a little under $23,000 with standard 4-wheel drive, the classic Wrangler is one of the best SUV values available. The 6-speed manual transmission helps the Wrangler achieve a decent 17 mpg city and 21 mpg highway rating. Jeep considers the Wrangler's off-road prowess integral to the brand and they continue to make one of the most capable 4-wheel drive vehicles available. Interesting features of this model are 2- and 4-door configurations available, impressive off-road prowess, and Iconic styling","3 Years/36,000 Miles","5 Years/60,000 Miles",5 Years/Unlimited Miles,"5 Years/100,000 Miles",FALSE,Kendall Ford of Meridian,Sport,NA,2016,Used,Provo,Dealer,Automatic,1604,17,21
